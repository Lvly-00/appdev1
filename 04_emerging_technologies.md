## Usage

### In Education

Automation is applied in education to simplify registration and admissions processes, which involve multiple forms and applications for student acceptance, enrollment, and course registration. Automating these procedures reduces repetition and staff workload by eliminating the need to manually check each application and create shortlists.  

**Example:** Many institutions use **Zenphi** integrated with Google Workspace for Education to automate student onboarding workflows â€” from receiving online application forms, verifying details, to sending enrollment confirmation emails automatically.

### In IT

Deploying new virtualized servers, connecting networks, and configuring storage volumes are all routine provisioning chores for IT managers.  IT automation can significantly speed up the majority of these provisioning processes, enabling the rapid and repeatable deployment of new IT environments. 

**Example:** A company uses **VMware vSphere** with **vRealize Automation** to automatically provision new virtualized servers when a developer requests them through a self-service portal.
