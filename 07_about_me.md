# Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub to enhance my knowledge in coding, particularly in version control and collaboration. Understanding Git allows me to efficiently manage code changes and track the history of my projects. GitHub, on the other hand, offers a platform for collaboration with other developers, allowing me to share my code, contribute to open-source projects, and improve my coding practices in real-world scenarios.
